# How to be happy when your data are SAD

*Best practices for the analysis of species abundance distributions*

Species abundance distributions (SADs) constitute a central pattern in ecology.  Their seemingly law-like behavior across systems has suggested to many that there must be universal mechanisms that produce generate the distribution of abundances across species.  We still really haven't figured out what those universal mechanisms are.  Some of this lack of progress is due to inconsistent, and quite often sub-optimal or downright wrong, statistical methods applied to SAD data.  In this project I address this problem by developing a set of robust, well validated methods for analyzing SADs.
